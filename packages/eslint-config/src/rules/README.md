# Rules

Each file contains only the rules that are specific to its name.
When a new plugin is introduced, a new rule file must be named after the plugin
and it should only contain rules that are specific to it.
If core rule is needed to be suppressed, must be done in the same config file as
the plugin rules are declared.
