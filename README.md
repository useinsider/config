## ESLint Configurations

Our ESLint configurations offer a diverse set of rules suitable for various
project structures. To integrate these configurations into your project,
explore the [`eslint-config`] directory and follow the instructions.

[`eslint-config`]: ./packages/eslint-config/#readme

## Stylelint Configurations

Similarly, our Stylelint configurations provide tailored rule sets for
different project types. Visit the [`stylelint-config`] directory to learn how
to apply these configurations.

### About StyleLint
Stylelint is a powerful linter designed specifically for styling files,
similar in function to ESLint but focused on stylesheets.

## TypeScript/JavaScript Configurations

For TypeScript and JavaScript, we provide `tsconfig` and `jsconfig` files,
respectively. These configuration files standardize project structures and
reduce redundancy across projects. To utilize these configurations, head to
the [`tsconfig`] directory and follow the setup instructions.
